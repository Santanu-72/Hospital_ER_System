# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Hospital Emergency Room (ER) data using Microsoft Excel to monitor patient flow, treatment efficiency, and operational performance.

The objective of this project was to clean and transform raw hospital data, calculate key performance metrics, and build an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

This project demonstrates my ability to perform data cleaning, KPI calculation, and dashboard development using Excel as a business intelligence tool.
